# Introduction
First off, thank you for considering to contribute. Contribution is welcomed.

# Ways to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute, even if you aren't confident in your coding skills.

* Reporting bugs
* Resolving bugs
* Adding features
* Suggesting new features
* Implementing new features
* Writing tests
* Writing documentation
* Refactoring with more maintainable programming techniques.
* Providing suggestions to how the code could be constructed better

# Ground Rules
Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. 
Check whether Stack Overflow can resolve your issue.
Use the project Wiki for project discussion or support enquiries.

Responsibilities
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by creating documentation, tests or looking through any help-wanted issues.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project
    * Send a pull request

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email the project owner instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of VS are you using (VS version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
General questions should go to the wiki instead of the issue tracker.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the project, open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a non-regular basis. 
Any code review activity will be via the Wiki.

# Community
Any communty activity will be via the Wiki.
